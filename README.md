# Project Name: Self-Driving Delivery System

## Overview
This project aims to develop a self-driving delivery system utilizing IoT devices and user interfaces to facilitate efficient product delivery. The system will involve two main user interfaces: one for customers to place orders and submit their location IDs, and another for sellers to manage orders and dispatch deliveries. The core functionality will involve a low-cost, autonomous self-driving car capable of navigating to delivery locations based on provided coordinates.

## Features
- **User Interfaces:**
  - Customer Interface: Allows users to place orders, submit their location IDs, and track delivery status.
  - Seller Interface: Enables sellers to manage orders, assign deliveries, and track delivery progress.
- **Autonomous Self-Driving Car:**
  - The self-driving car will be controlled by a program designed to find the shortest path to delivery locations.
  - Utilizes IoT devices for real-time tracking and monitoring of the vehicle's location and status.
- **Notifications:**
  - Automated notifications will be sent to customers and sellers upon order placement, delivery assignment, and delivery completion.

## Goals
- Develop a cost-effective self-driving delivery system that optimizes delivery routes and enhances efficiency.
- Provide a seamless user experience for both customers and sellers through intuitive user interfaces and timely notifications.
- Implement robust security measures to protect user data and ensure the integrity of the delivery process.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript
- Frameworks/Libraries: Flask, React.js
- IoT Devices: GPS modules, sensors
- Mapping APIs: Google Maps API, OpenStreetMap API
